# First Blog Post
This repository contains the code used to create the first blog post.
post_script.R contains only the code used to download the data,
generate plots and final table. To use this code you must have 
the following libraries installed
1. tidyverse
2. labelled
3. cesR
To download them use the command
```{R}
install.packages(packagename)
```

The .Rmd file contains the actual blog post, that is, both the 
text and code. We recommend you have installed LaTex to properly 
view all equations.
